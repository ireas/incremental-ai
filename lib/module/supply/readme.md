# Supply Module

The **Supply** module provides resources to manage and are thus a core component of the game.

> [!NOTE]
> *Additional ideas...*
> - different supply types that automatically behave in different ways
> - additive and multiplicative property changes with sources

## Models

The module contains only one type of model.

- **Supply**: a simple resource that has current amount, maximum capacity and a change rate per second.
