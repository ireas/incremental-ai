# Notification Module

The **Notification** module provides notifications that contain information that is presented via a small pop-up to the player.
This feature provides responsiveness to actions and thus increases immersion. Moreover, it can be used to guide the player.

> [!NOTE]
> **Additional Ideas...**
> - implement a onClose method that is called after closing the notification to trigger any actions
> - define different notification types, each with their own color and icon

## Models

- **Notification**: a non-unique model that is used to store a notifications title and message.
