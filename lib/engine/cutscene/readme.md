# Cutscene Module

The **Cutscene** module provides an immersive way to show some story content to the player. It increases the immersion and offers a break.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional Ideas...
> - smoother transition between two cutscenes right after another
> - more complex animated cutscenes
> - consider using typewriter effect
> - sound (reading the text for example)

## Models
